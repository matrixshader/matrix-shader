Title: [Show] Matrix Terminal Shader - Bring the iconic falling code effect to Windows Terminal

I built a pixel shader that adds the classic Matrix falling code effect to Windows Terminal. It's GPU-accelerated, smooth, and makes every coding session feel like you're hacking the mainframe.

Features:
- Authentic Matrix green glow
- GPU-accelerated (no performance impact)
- Works with any terminal content
- Easy installation

If you like it, consider starring the repo or buying me a coffee - it helps me justify spending nights on making terminals cooler!
