Hey! I'm [Your Name], and I build tools that make terminals beautiful.

I created the Matrix Terminal Shader - a pixel shader that brings the iconic falling code effect to Windows Terminal. It's GPU-accelerated, buttery smooth, and makes every coding session feel like you're inside The Matrix.

This project is free and open source, but your support helps me:

- Spend more time adding new effects
- Improve performance optimization
- Create better documentation
- Keep the project actively maintained

Every coffee directly funds development time and shows me that the community values this work.

If the Matrix Terminal Shader has made your terminal experience cooler, I'd really appreciate a coffee!

GitHub: [YOUR_GITHUB_LINK]

### 3.4 Thank You Message (Auto-sent to supporters)

```

1. I'll add your name to the supporters section in the GitHub README within 24 hours (unless you prefer to stay anonymous - just reply to let me know)

2. You now have my direct attention - reply to this message with any feature requests or ideas, and I'll prioritize them

3. You'll get early access info for new features before public release

Seriously, this means a lot. Every supporter motivates me to keep making terminals cooler.
