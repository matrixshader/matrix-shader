## Project: Matrix Shader v2 - Complete Fix

### Previous Attempt: FAILED
All 20 stories were incorrectly marked complete without functional testing.
Nothing actually worked:
- All windows opened same color (profiles pointed to same shader)
- Windows cascaded instead of positioned side-by-side
- Tab switching removed from TUI
- Visual bars removed from TUI
- Fine RGB control removed
- Wrong defaults (too bright)
- bluepill command didn't work
- No progress was logged

### This Attempt: 10 Corrected User Stories
- US-001: Fix profile shader paths (BLOCKING)
- US-002: matrix_setup.ps1 updates profiles (BLOCKING)
- US-003: Window positioning works
- US-004: TUI tab switching
- US-005: TUI visual bars
- US-006: Fine RGB control
- US-007: Correct defaults
- US-008: bluepill instant launch
- US-009: TUI can launch windows
- US-010: Progress logging (THIS!)

## Codebase Patterns

### Key Files (CORRECT locations - NOT MVP folder!)
- `C:\Users\ehome\Documents\Matrix\matrix_setup.ps1` - Setup wizard (wakeupneo)
- `C:\Users\ehome\Documents\Matrix\matrix_control.ps1` - Full TUI (redpill)
- `C:\Users\ehome\Documents\Matrix\bluepill.ps1` - Instant launch (to be created)
- `C:\Users\ehome\Documents\Matrix\shaders\Matrix-N.hlsl` - Per-window shaders
- Windows Terminal settings: `C:\Users\ehome\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\settings.json`

### Launcher Commands
- `wakeupneo` -> matrix_setup.ps1 (setup wizard)
- `redpill` -> matrix_control.ps1 (full TUI with tab switching)
- `bluepill` -> bluepill.ps1 (instant launch, no prompts)

### Critical Architecture
Each Matrix-N profile MUST point to its own shader file:
```
Matrix-1 -> shaders/Matrix-1.hlsl
Matrix-2 -> shaders/Matrix-2.hlsl
...etc
```
