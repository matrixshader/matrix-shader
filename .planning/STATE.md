# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-25)

**Core value:** The C# version must work exactly like the PowerShell version does today
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Shader Service Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Shader Service Foundation)
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-01-26 — Completed 01-03-PLAN.md (ShaderService WriteConfig + CreateShader)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 10% (3/30 plans)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 7 min
- Total execution time: 0.35 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-shader-service-foundation | 3 | 21 min | 7 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (8 min), 01-02 (5 min), 01-03 (8 min)
- Trend: Stable

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Phase order strict - Shader Control first, MatrixLite last (learned from previous failure)
- [Roadmap]: 10 phases for comprehensive depth, respecting research dependency chain
- [01-01]: PowerShell is source of truth for parameter validation ranges
- [01-01]: Clamp() returns new instance (immutable record pattern)
- [01-02]: HLSL file is source of truth for #define names (regex patterns must match exactly)
- [01-02]: Layer toggles parsed as float > 0.5 (not int comparison)
- [01-02]: InvariantCulture for float parsing (locale safety)
- [01-03]: F1 format (one decimal place) for shader values, matching PowerShell
- [01-03]: WriteConfig auto-creates missing files via CreateShader
- [01-03]: UTF8Encoding(false) for HLSL files (no BOM)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Previous C# attempt failed by building MatrixLite before core shader control worked
- Must test in Windows Sandbox after each phase to catch missing dependencies early
